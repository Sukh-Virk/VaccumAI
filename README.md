## ðŸ¤– Vacuum Cleaning AI Project

One of my most exciting projects is an AI-powered vacuum cleaner simulation. This AI navigates a grid environment, avoiding obstacles and efficiently cleaning the space. It utilizes:

A Algorithm* for smart navigation and pathfinding.

Greedy Search for quick, heuristic-based movement.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) for systematic exploration.

Uniform Cost Search (UCS) to optimize path efficiency.

Cost-based movement decisions, ensuring the AI chooses optimal paths.

Step, turn, stay, and left functions, giving the AI fine-tuned movement capabilities
